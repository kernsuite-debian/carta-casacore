carta-casacore for Debian

This package provides a build of a custom revision of casacore with the addition 
of the CASA image analysis library. This is required as a dependency for the 
CARTA image viewer. See the changelog for the revisions of the upstream source 
which were used. This package was built with FFTW3, HDF5 and OpenMP. The Python 
modules are not built. All files are installed into a custom directory in /opt,
and the binary packages don't clash with standard packaged versions of casacore.
